[Here's an earlier blog post with some thoughts on javascript](https://stu.itp.nyu.edu/~eef206/blog/nature-of-code-week-1-random-walker/ ).

Both of these samples include memes, \([Baneposting](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/baneposting) and [doge](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge), respectively \) but the audience was myself and my mostly 20-something grad school classmates.
