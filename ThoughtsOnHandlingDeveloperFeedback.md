# Thoughts on handling developer feedback in a public forum
Thanks to podcasting and writing the AnimeNewsNetwork column for three years, I have some experience engaging with an online audience of r a few thousand people, some of whom can be unpleasant at times. 

## Scenario 1
> Twitter reads: "Hey, Adobe CC: your API isnâ€™t working." We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

The best practice for Twitter is to have some responses written and ready to go in advance. We should have a handful of draft tweets for this kind of situation with the following types of responses:

- From our end the API appears to be up and running. Can you tell me what kind of error you're getting?
- Please follow our account and DM us with a screenshot of what you're seeing.
- What's the best communication method for us to help you troubleshoot?

## Scenario 2
> We did a quick gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.

We should have a queue of responses on hand for this sort of scenario as well. I think it's important to have management pre-approve the template for tweets to be used in both scenarios, as well as agree upon the general plan of action for both scenarios.

- You're right, some of our APIs are down at the moment. We're working on the problem now.
- Responding to tweets that haven't noticed the previous response:
  - We're aware of the problem and working on a solution right now.
  
- After the APIs are back up, take the time to reply \(or write an app to automatically reply to\) all of the twitter users who pointed out the problem, saying something to the effect of:
  - Thanks for taking the time to let us know. We think the APIs are back up and running now. Please tell us if you're still experiencing problems.
