Thanks to podcasting and writing the AnimeNewsNetwork column for three years, I have some experience 

## Scenario 1
> Twitter reads: "Hey, Adobe CC: your API isnâ€™t working." We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

## Scenario 2
> We did a quick gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.
