# Thoughts on handling developer feedback in a public forum
Thanks to podcasting and writing the AnimeNewsNetwork column, I have years of experience engaging with an online audience of a few thousand people, some of whom can be unpleasant at times. 

## Scenario 1
> Twitter reads: "Hey, Adobe CC: your API isn't working." We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

The best practice for Twitter is to have some responses written and ready to go in advance. We should have a handful of draft tweets for this kind of situation with the following types of responses:

- From our end the API appears to be up and running. Can you tell me what kind of error you're getting?
- Please follow our account and DM us with a screenshot of what you're seeing.
- What's the best communication method for us to help you troubleshoot?

## Scenario 2
> We did a quick gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.

In my seven years of technical support at NYU I've learned:
- Customers/users/students want to feel heard and cared for
- Don't be afraid to apologize

We should have a queue of responses on hand for this sort of scenario as well. I think it's important to have management pre-approve the template for tweets to be used in both scenarios, as well as agree upon the general plan of action for both scenarios.

- You're right, some of our APIs are down at the moment. We're working on the problem now.
- Responding to tweets that haven't noticed the previous response:
  - We're aware of the problem and working on a solution right now.
- After the APIs are back up, take the time to reply (or write an app to automatically reply to) all of the twitter users who pointed out the problem, saying something to the effect of:
  - Thanks for taking the time to let us know. We think the APIs are back up and running now. Please tell us if you're still experiencing problems.
  - If possible personalize some of the replies after the clean up to let the developers know we read each one, especially to the people who seemed the most passionate about the problem.
  - I've found that developers and engineers appreciate honesty and brevity.  After such a problem, posting some of the technical details of what happened will satisfy the curiosity of parts of the community.

For pre-written replies, it's best to have a philosophy or guideline in place to frame the answers, e.g. “we always value customer privacy above all else” or “customers who use our products to make memes take priority” etc.

## Speed is Critical

Responding in a timely, if not instantaneously, is definitely key to twitter. I work second shift at NYU, and find it frustrating trying to contact tech support for software after 5pm Eastern.  As Community Engineer I would need to know:
- Who monitors the Twitter account overnight and on weekends?
- Who monitors the Twitter account on holidays unique to the U.S.?
- Who monitors the Twitter account during normal business hours when I'm at an all-staff meeting?

## Twitter in General

In general I've found Twitter to be a good platform to get a fast response from otherwise large and faceless corporations.  I like it when corporate accounts have a good sense of humor, like in [this instance ](http://www.adweek.com/creativity/wendys-put-troll-ice-2017s-best-tweet-so-far-175334/) where Wendy's chided someone for [forgetting about refrigeration ](https://twitter.com/Wendys/status/815973811115925504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adweek.com%2Fcreativity%2Fwendys-put-troll-ice-2017s-best-tweet-so-far-175334%2F).  That said, the user had to delete their account.

That kind of response might be appropriate for Wendy's brand image, but not for Adobe.  If I'm going to represent Adobe CC on twitter I would need to know:
- What is the company's brand image?
- What rules are already in place for community engagement? \(I would also be happy to write those rules, as needed.\)
- What are Adobe's goals for online presence and engagement?
- Am I responding as an individual with a name, or as a brand? Am I "Erin from Adobe CC" or just "Adobe CC"?

I opened my Twitter account in 2008, mostly to engage with the anime journalism community online.  When I started writing the AnimeNewsNetwork.com column in 2009 I got 3,000 new followers overnight.  Although no one at ANN trained me to do so, I took it upon myself to interact with twitter users the same way I did with forum readers, by:
- Using gentle good humor.
- Killing them with kindness.
- Not feeding the trolls.

I also knew that the editors of AnimeNewsNetwork had my back. When someone even jokingly threatened physical violence once, they were banned from the forum \(with an explanation from the head of the company\) before I saw the message.  The editors stepped in when the readers got too aggressive at times.  It's important to plan in advance for that kind of scenario as well. In other words:
- How does Adobe deal with customers making threats or stalking the Community Engineer?

## Twitter as a Resource

Soon, I found that with enough followers, Twitter was a great resource for writing the column.  At any time of day or night,  I could crowdsource answers to un-Goolge-able questions \("Hey what was the title of that anime with the pirate cat?" etc.\).

A loyal Twitter following that feels a personal connection can be a great resource.  For Adobe, a dedicated, respected community person could get helpful feedback, such as:
- What's our top bug that you'd like to see squashed today?
- Which new feature are you looking forward to most in the next update?
- Who would like to beta test a pre-release API tomorrow?
- Has anyone else gotten this error? If so when? \(Retweeting errors from the community\)
