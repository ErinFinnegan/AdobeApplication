## Existing Examples of Community Engagement or Marketing Outreach

### Marketing content you’ve written.
- In an attempt to find sponsorships for my zero gravity wedding, we launched a personal marketing campaign. I wrote the [wedding website](http://www.erinfinnegan.com/sam/?page_id=82) (the graphics are no longer in place)
  - My photo is in the 2011 Guinness Book of World Records, and mentioned in later books
  - According to Nielsen, over 26.1 million people have saw TV segments of my weightless wedding  
  - The wedding appeared in 500 television segments, more than 500 individual articles & blogs and over 6,000 Web hits
  - We were also interviewed on the CBS Early Morning show, featured in three print magazines, and interviewed on two radio shows.

- At Lerner's Graphic Universe, I essentially wrote the marketing blog:
   -  [My Wordpress author tag on their site](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/author/erinfinnegan/)
   -  [Some convention coverage for Lerner](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/mocca2010/)
   -  [Gathering coverage of a book's launch ](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/early-praise-for-nolas-worlds/)

### Open source projects you’ve contributed to, or a write-up of your contributions to a closed source project that we can verify.
  - I received a Google Experiments in Storytelling Grant for [this project ](https://github.com/futuremarc/Twitch-Plays-Hamlet). It's called [Twitch Plays Shakespeare](http://fromjia.com/projects/twitch/). I created and directed the project, collaborated on coding it, and hired Jia as the graphic designer (her write up is in the preceding link).
  - I collaborated on [this RESTful application ](https://github.com/kinasmith/isTheFloorFeeding/blob/master/heroku/public/index.html) that powers a lighted box (see below) whenever free food is available in another part of the studio. The app [still exists](http://isthefloorfeeding.herokuapp.com/) on heroku but the physical component of the project is no longer in place.
  - Here's [my first ever pull request](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-S14/pull/1) , which I did in [Dan Shiffman's](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) Nature of Code class at [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp). 
 - My final project in that class was written in javascript.
    - Here's [a code sample ](https://github.com/ErinFinnegan/Omnomitron/blob/master/itallhappenshere.js)
    - Here's [a video of the code in action ](https://vimeo.com/100457165)

### Existing Examples of Community Engagement or Marketing Outreach

I got paid for 10 years to engage with the anime and manga fan community as an anime journalist. I got into it by [starting a podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ninja-consultant-podcast/id74941727?mt=2). I reviewed anime and manga and wrote convention coverage for Publishers Weekly, Otaku USA Magazine, and AnimeNewsNetwork.com.

### Product launches you were involved in.
  - I wrote for Otaku USA from the 2nd issue on, so in the magazine's first year I was invited to sit on this panel, which I recorded for my podcast: [Otaku USA Magazine panel at New York Anime Festival 2008](http://ninjaconsultant.com/?m=200811)
  - [I interviewed the author of The Rough Guide to Anime](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/12974-an-anime-canon-for-all.html), as press for his book launch for Publishers Weekly.

### Forum/Stackoverflow/etc answers you’ve written.
- I spent three years writing for [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/advertising), where part of my job as columnist was daily interaction with readers in the forum. In this example, I used insider jargon [incorrectly in a review](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2010-01-04#spice), causing [the forums to light up that week](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=126151).  You know it's going to be bad when the reaction post is:
   > Did you just call Horo a tsundere? To quote the great Inigo Montoya 'there will be blood tonight!' ...in the forum that is. 
I learned that even as a critic you have to keep the content in line with audience expectations.

### Details on email campaigns you’ve driven.
- In 2016 [I did this kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/432973105/puppet-vr-murder-mystery) for a personal project, the "Puppet VR Murder Mystery". I was selected from hundreds of applicant to pitch the project at the [NY Media Center's VR Pitchfest](http://nymediacenter.com/events/event/?id=46910F62-0543-4157-B569EF3C490345BE&slugid=virtual-reality-pitchfest), to a Shark Tank of professionals.
  - I used [a Gmail add-on script](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-merge-with-attachmen/nifmcbjailaccmombpjjpijjbfoicppp) to email 80 people per day for a somewhat personal touch.
  - I also used SurveyMonkey and GreenInbox to try and reach all my Gmail, Facebook, and Twitter contacts, using automated yet  personalized direct messages, to make sure every single one of my contacts knew about the project in time.

- In 2016, I co-created an interactive theater piece called ["The Institute"](https://sharangbiswas.myportfolio.com/the-institute), which received a Google Experiments in Storytelling Grant.  In terms of the marketing campaign, I was in charge of [creating the Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/TheInstituteAtTheBrick/) during the performances.


###  Decks are also welcome.
  - Ash already knew about [my Master's thesis](https://vimeo.com/128758304) which I consider my best presentation.

 - [Here is the second best presentation I've ever given](https://vimeo.com/30828018).  I cover 300+ slides in under an hour. 
   - That panel represents eight years of learning, in a deep dive into manga, and Japanese culture. I went from zero to an expert in the subject in a handful of years.
