### Existing Examples of Community Engagement or Marketing Outreach

I spent 10 years as a journalist engaging with the anime and manga fan community. I got into it by [starting a podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ninja-consultant-podcast/id74941727?mt=2), and I met other podcasters who were anime magazine writers first and podcasters second; soon I started getting paid gigs reviewing anime and manga and writing convention coverage, for Publishers Weekly, Otaku USA Magazine, and AnimeNewsNetwork.com.

### Product launches you were involved in.
  - I wrote for Otaku USA from the 2nd issue on, so in the magazine's first year I was invited to sit on this panel, which I recorded for my podcast: [Otaku USA Magazine panel at New York Anime Festival 2008](http://ninjaconsultant.com/?m=200811)
  - [I interviewed the author of The Rough Guide to Anime](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/12974-an-anime-canon-for-all.html), as press for his book launch for Publishers Weekly.

### Marketing content you’ve written (preferably for a technical audience).
- At Lerner's Graphic Universe, I essentially wrote the marketing blog:
   -  [My Wordpress author tag on their site](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/author/erinfinnegan/)
   -  [Some convention coverage for Lerner](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/mocca2010/)
   -  [Gathering coverage of a book's release](https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/early-praise-for-nolas-worlds/)

### Forum/Stackoverflow/etc answers you’ve written.
- I spent three years writing for [Anime News Network], where part of my job as columnist was daily interaction with readers in the forum. In this example, I used insider jargon [incorrectly in a review](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2010-01-04#spice), causing [the forums to light up that week](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=126151).  You know it's going to be bad when the reaction post is:
   > Did you just call Horo a tsundere? To quote the great Inigo Montoya 'there will be blood tonight!' ...in the forum that is. 
   
- Fortunately I [liked season two better](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2011-09-26#spice), but I had to make peace with the readers:
  
   > You know, I learned a lot by reviewing Spice and Wolf season one. I learned never to use words like “furry” or “tsundere,” even if I think I know what those words mean. I learned that many readers consider “Rental Shelf” to be a pan (I disagree). I learned that anime fans love Spice and Wolf.

### Details on email campaigns you’ve driven.


### Open source projects you’ve contributed to, or a write-up of your contributions to a closed source project that we can verify.
  - Here's [my first ever pull request](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-S14/pull/1) , which I did in [Dan Shiffman's](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) amazing Nature of Code class at [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp): 
 - My final project in that class was written in javascript.
    - Here's [a code sample](https://github.com/ErinFinnegan/Omnomitron/blob/master/itallhappenshere.js)
    - Here's [a video of the code working](https://vimeo.com/100457165)
- [Here's a RESTful application](https://github.com/kinasmith/isTheFloorFeeding/blob/master/heroku/public/index.html) that I collaborated on with a classmate (the page [still exists](http://isthefloorfeeding.herokuapp.com/) on heroku).
    - See the image below of the physical component of the project

###  Decks are also welcome.
 - [Here is the second best presentation I've ever given](https://vimeo.com/30828018).  I cover 300+ slides in under an hour. 
   - That panel represents eight years of learning, in a deep dive into manga, and Japanese culture. I went from zero to an expert in the subject in a handful of years.
 - I consider [my Master's thesis](https://vimeo.com/128758304) my best presentation, but I didn't spent as much time on it.
