# Existing Examples of Community Engagement or Marketing Outreach

I spent 10 years as a journalist engaging with the anime and manga fan community.

* Product launches you were involved in.
  - I wrote for Otaku USA from the 2nd issue on, so in the magazine's first year I was invited to sit on this panel, which I recorded for my podcast: [Otaku USA Magazine panel at New York Anime Festival 2008](http://ninjaconsultant.com/?m=200811)

* Maketing content you’ve written (preferably for a technical audience).


* Forum/Stackoverflow/etc answers you’ve written.

* Details on email campaigns you’ve driven.


* Any other tangible asset that might help us learn more about your experience in these areas.

* Open source projects you’ve contributed to, or a write-up of your contributions to a closed source project that we can verify.

Here's my first ever pull request, which I did in Daniel @Shiffman's amazing Nature of Code class: [https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-S14/pull/1] 
 - My final project in that class was written in javascript.
    - Here's a code sample [ https://github.com/ErinFinnegan/Omnomitron/blob/master/itallhappenshere.js ]
    - Here's a video of the code working [ https://vimeo.com/100457165 ]

*  Decks are also welcome.
 - Here is the best presentation I've ever given.  I cover 300+ slides in under an hour: [ https://vimeo.com/30828018 ]
 - That panel represents eight years of learning, in a deep dive into manga, and Japanese culture. I went from zero to an expert in the subject in a handful of years...

At Lerner's Graphic Universe, I essentially wrote the marketing blog:

- Some convention coverage: [ https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/mocca2010/ ]
- Gathering coverage of a book's release: [ https://graphicuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/early-praise-for-nolas-worlds/ ]
